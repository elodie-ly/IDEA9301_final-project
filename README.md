## Vision Statement

Our team will reinterpret Manolo Gamboa Naon’s *CUDA*, a colourful generative artwork created with Processing. We are inspired by its layered circles, transparent shapes, geometric fragments, and strong contrast between warm and cool colours. We will modify the original artwork into an interactive p5.js piece where shapes do not stay still, but move, pulse, rotate, and respond to sound, time, randomness, and user input. Based on the *CUDA* images we saw on Behance, our version will keep the dense abstract composition and rich colour palette, but transform it into a living visual system. Circles, rectangles, lines, and translucent layers will share the canvas like a digital atmosphere. The work will explore how simple shapes can become complex, emotional, and energetic when they are controlled by code.

## Mechanic 2: Time-Based Mechanic

**Owner:** yunyi liu(Elodie) / yliu0027
**Mechanic:** Employ timers and events to drive the mechanic.

The time-based mechanic will control the main visual rhythm of the artwork. Inspired by the changing density and layered composition of *CUDA*, this mechanic will use timers to create different visual phases. For example, every 8–10 seconds, the canvas can shift between a warm phase, a cool phase, a high-energy phase, and a calm phase. In each phase, the background colour, transparency, shape speed, and rotation amount will change. Timed events can also trigger new circles, rectangles, or line bursts to appear automatically. The user does not need to do anything for this mechanic to work; the artwork will continuously evolve by itself. This connects to our vision because it turns the original static image into a living generative system. The timed changes help the canvas feel like an active digital artwork rather than a still poster.

### Time-Based Mechanic Diagram

```text
0–10 sec: warm orange/red phase
10–20 sec: cool blue/green phase
20–30 sec: bright yellow energy burst
30–40 sec: darker layered calm phase
then repeat
```

### p5.js Code Idea

```javascript
if (frameCount % 600 === 0) {
  phase = (phase + 1) % 4;
}
```
